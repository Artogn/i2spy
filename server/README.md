# The Server Bits

You have to make a database before you run this.
To do that, run `python server.py -c`.

Adding tokens is still a manual process, you have to add them to the nodes table.

Collection and viewing are in two parts:

## Dependencies

`pip install jinja2 i2py matplotlib`

* jinja2 - template engnine
* i2py - connecting to router information
* matplotlib - 

## Collection
