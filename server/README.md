# The Server Bits

You have to make a database before you run this.
To do that, run `python server.py -c`.

Adding tokens is still a manual process, you have to add them to the nodes table.

Collection and viewing are in two parts:

## Dependencies

`pip install Flask i2py`

## Collection

`python collector.py`

## Viewer

`python viewer.py`
